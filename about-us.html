        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="primary-text">We Raise With Care</p>
        <br>
        <p>Mermar Nature Farm, outdoor reared pig producers in Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo, utilising the light free draining soils and relatively dry climate, our business operates a closed breeding herd and prides itself on its high health status, professional management and absolute focus on the highest standards of pig welfare.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All our pigs are reared outdoors and then moved into large straw filled, naturally ventilated barns. We own a number of in house finishing farms, however we also have a large number of local contract pig finishers and always have opportunities for local farmers across East Anglia who would like to diversify into pig farming.</p>
