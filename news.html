        <p>China to stabilise grain production, ensure livestock supply in 2022</p>
        <br>
        <p>China will stabilise corn production and expand soybean output in the new year to ensure grain security, the Communist Party's People's Daily quoted the agriculture minister as saying on Monday.

            "Safeguarding supply security of grains, and important agricultural and sideline products is always our top task and main priority," Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Tang Renjian said in an interview with People's Daily.</p> 
            <br>
        <p>"Agricultural and rural affairs departments must devote every effort to grain production, with the attitude of conducting a desperate fight, and with extraordinary and super strength."

            Tang's comments come against the backdrop of lingering concern over food security in the world's most populous country as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt food supply chains and logistics across the globe, reported Reuters.
